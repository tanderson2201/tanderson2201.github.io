####  QR Phishing
{: data-toc-skip='AI Chatbots in Security' .mt-4 .mb-0 }

Known as Quishing is the practice of using QR scanning to redirect victims to a malicious site or program. This can be done virtually on messaging services/emails or physically on information boards/posters. 

The use of QR codes is becoming more common for accessing websites, media, information as well as used to authenticate account logins. Consequently, users are at risk of mistaken phishing QR codes for legitimate codes.  

Due to the QR code hiding the URL, it can be used to bypass email filters. Allowing for malicious QR codes to evade email security systems. Therefore, it is best practice to implement Quishing training and email simulations across your organisation. 


####  Examples

- Microsoft Credentials Quishing
Attackers send phishing emails containing QR codes mimicking Microsoft Authenticator emails used for authentication services. The QR code will redirect the user to a fake Microsoft site where they will be advised to enter their Microsoft Credentials. This attack is becoming more common due to the ease and potential gain for private or confidential information of an account.
