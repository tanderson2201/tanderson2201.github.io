####  FREE TIME
{: data-toc-skip='' .mt-4 }

In my free time I like to work on my home environment that is running on Proxmox Virtual Environment (Unix-based). I use the environment to deploy and test servers running Virtual Private Networks on ZeroTier, hosting analytics using NetData, Internet Information Services, Domain Name Services and Active Directory. I then use PFSense to sandbox and maintain the environment. I am passionate about keeping up to date with the newest IT technology which will allow me to implement innovative technologies into my network. In addition to this, I use the environment to host websites for friends and family and I am keen to keep developing sites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SSL.
